## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This document will describe the portions of the Magicoach project for organizational purposes. This document is intended for use by Magicoach team members to have a consistent schema for the design of the project.

### 1.2 Product Scope
This document specifies the initial build of Magicoach. This is the repository containing the server code, which will contain both client page generation code and server request handling code. This software is a way for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) players to find coaching when needed for tournaments etc. and for coaches to have a place to advertise their services. Currently, many MTG coaches are sole proprietors, and this would allow them to have a consistent platform & reach.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations                                                                                                         
| Term | Definition                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| MTG  | Magic: The Gathering         |

### 1.4 References
All HTML code generated by Magicoach will validate with [W3C's HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
Magicoach will compile with the current Java compiler (JDK 25 LTS) without warnings.

### 1.5 Document Overview
This document lays out the product specifications including functions, constraints, interfaces, and requirements. Refer to the table of contents to view a specific section.

## 2. Product Overview
This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.

### 2.1 Product Functions
For coach users: 
* Coaches will be able to view requests for coaching services
* Coaches will be able to advertise thier name, availability, price, and summary of services
* Coaches will be able to see their recent payment statistics
* Coaches will be able to post on a subscribable feed, both images and text
* Coaches will be able to read reviews about their services

For client users:
* Clients will be able to view available coaches
* Clients will be able to subscribe to coaches
* Clients will be able to see posts from coaches they have subscribed to
* Clients will be able to purchase services through the website
* Clients will be able to post and edit their own reviews of coaches
* Clients will only be able to review services they have ordered

### 2.2 Product Constraints
This product has a requirement to be built fully in Java. This may impact ease of development. Code will compile without errors, which constrains code but will be good for ease of coding later on. The software will be running on a virtual cloud server, so its performance will need to be well-optimized to handle connections while operating with limited CPU resources.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
* Coaches: Coach Users who are creating pages advertising their services for purchasing by customers. Very important.
* Paying Users: Client Users who regularly use coaches' paid services. Important.
* Non-paying users: Client Users who do not regularly use coaches' paid services. Not as important.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements 
This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

The specific requirements should:
* Be uniquely identifiable.
* State the subject of the requirement (e.g., system, software, etc.) and what shall be done.
* Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
* Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
* Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
* Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.
(You do your half of the users, I will fill in mine)

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
The software will handle requests and connections over HTTP through a standard TCP socket. Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 will be supported, with TLS (https). Communication with the database will use internal sockets, and the database will not be exposed to the open Internet.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Non Functional Requirements 

#### 3.2.1 Performance
Average request timings should not increase when handling 20 concurrent requests or less. 

#### 3.2.2 Security
Passwords will not be directly stored, instead using salted hashes. Users will be able to register authenticator apps. Password resets will be provided by email. Password resets will require authenticator app usage for users with authenticator apps registered. Authenticators will use the TOTP protocol, HMAC SHA-1 variant. 

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
500-type errors will be returned at an average of 0.5% of requests or lower, not including scheduled maintenance windows. This error rate will be tracked. 

#### 3.2.4 Availability
Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart.

#### 3.2.5 Compliance
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations

#### 3.2.6 Cost
None

#### 3.2.7 Deadline
Deadlines follow the course assignment deadlines.
