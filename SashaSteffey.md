## About Me
I am a Senior in CS, interested in both software and firmware development. I have experience professionally and personally in many languages and technologies, and I am always interested in getting to know more about software, how it works, and how to make it better.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to be able to get experience with corporate development styles and learn how to effectively become part of a programming team. This class should help me develop the skills and progress needed to get there.
