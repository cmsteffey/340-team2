## About Me
I am a Senior in CS, interested in both software and firmware development. I have experience professionally and personally in many languages and technologies, and I am always open to learn more about software, how it's made, and how I can make it better.

## My CSC340 Goals
I hope to be able to get experience with corporate software development skills such as development flows, teamwork, and proper version control. I am excited to further these skills and have a cohesive project at the end of the course to demonstrate what I've learned.
