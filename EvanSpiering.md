# Evan Spiering

## About Me
Hello, my name is Evan Spiering and I am an aspiring game developer looking to grow into a fantastic coder. Currently I am 22 years old and seeking my BS 
from UNCG placing me at graduation in the spring semester of 2026. My passion lies with game development because I am very creative and always love to 
test the bounds of what is "the norm". Game development is a perfect place for me to experiment with feel and put my own spin on normal every day 
thoughts. Although game development is extremely hard I also find it to be one of the most rewarding forms of coding because you have to put every bit of 
thought into so many different pieces like art, sound, code, and feel. Currently I am developing a project from start to finish called "Overdrive" which 
is gonna be my first full development from idea to steam store releasing in 2025.

## My CSC340 Goals
This is one of my most anticipated classes at UNCG because it really puts in a situation where I can take the wheel and code stuff related to whatever 
interests me. My biggest goal for this class is to have a project which I am truly proud to say that I made in a group setting with my partner Sasha. 
Although I would not say that I am the better programmer of the group and definitely have grown immensly since just last semester. For me to put in a lot 
of effort and really make this application the best it can be would be my biggest goal.
